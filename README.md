# Discord Server-Bot Idea List

This is the idea pin board, where everyone can edit the *Idea.txt*-file,<br>fork the repository and create a pull request commit the new idea or the edit.
<br><br>The Bot is my Project for my Discord-Server and i'm planning this for years.
<br>To get more ideas and encouragement to start coding it, i created this.

**After the idea has been programmed, it is of course marked with the author or authors.**
